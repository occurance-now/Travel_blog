            <p7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture to the left is a photo looking out from my bamboo bungalow at the kitchen and living area of Gaarawe Village<br><br>"Everybody is looking for something"<br><br>Woke up this morning and did a light yoga session. Rice, egg, and vegetables for breakfast followed by a cup of coffee. It's weird eating alone with Lele. We finished digging the trench this morning. It's roughly 40 ft long and three feet deep. As funny as it sounds I'm actually proud of our trench.<br> In the mid-afternoon a a couple showed up. They told me they had been traveling together for almost two years and that most of their time was spent in New Zealand.They spent a almost 4 months working in a Winery on the south island. New Zealand really sounds like an incredible place. Maybe even the place for me. Snowboarding, diving, surfing, its got it all.<br>Another traveler also arrived today. She's from Texas and seems really nice. But I get the feeling shes running away from something. You can usually tell pretty easily with travelers. Some people are running away and some people are just seeing whats out there, its usually very obvious.<br>Right now I'm excited to keep traveling. But I cant fight the feeling I have in my gut that something is missing.<br> Lele told me today that the main problem the world is facing is social media. I dont think he's necessarily wrong I just think theres much more to it than that. Gaarawe is surrounded by a latex tree farm. Lele also noted that condoms are a bad thing. I'm all for playing devils advocate but in my mind there is absolutely no way anyone can argue against condoms...  </p7>

            <p7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture to the above is a photo looking out from my bamboo bungalow in the floating village on Lake Ratchaprapha<br><br>"It always happens when you lest expect it"-Kate (from Australia)<br><br>"Dont ever buy girls drinks"-(dude from Holland)<br><br>"Everybody these monkeys know me and I know them"-Lake Tour Guide<br><br>Khao Sok lake is a man made lake created by damning a valley that is surrounded by sheer 90 degree limestone cliffs. Although completely unatural its beauty is uncomparable and from my knowledge there's no other place on Earth that is asthetically similiar. Touruoise fresh water surrounded by dense bamboo forest that cover the hillsides. Monkeys are super abundant along the lakeside and seeing them is a given especially in the early morning hours.<br> The overnight tour that took me here was around 3,000 Baht ($70usd), very expensiv for Thailand. But the experience was worth every penny. I slept in a floating bungalow along side a string of other guest bungalows. In the middle there is a floating cafeteria. I was lucky enough to meet an awesome group of travellers here. Belgians, Australians, Germans, and Netherlandies(?). Highlights were cave exploring and hanging on the docks all night long. The only downside was that by 5am the local monkeys started howling at each other. It made it practically impossiblet to sleep! They were so loud!<br>The tour guides were wonderful. The main guide who I'm pretty sure gave himself a souto American name of Justin was hilarious. He kept yelling at the monkeys "monkeys you know me, and I know you!". To make it even better he stayed up all night with us. He gave us free liquor and pot (shhhh...). He was the man! Justin was probably the happiest individual I've ever meet. His constant up beat attitude was a nice reminder how happy someone can be when they're living the simple life. He actually told me I could come work with him as a tour guide if I'd like. At first thought this sounded like such a good idea. But the more I thought about the more I realized that I definitely don't want to be stuck on a lake in the middle of the mountains with no wifi or cell service for months.</p7>

            <p7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture to the left is a photo of my bungalow at Gaarawe Village. Often I would find spiders the size of my first crawling around at night.<br><br>Theme of the day: Work is work. Its called that for a reason. Oh and I could use a girlfriend.<br><br>Gaarawe Village is located in the jungles of Khao Sok National Park. Its basically a few small bamboo structures surrounded by traveler made fruit and vegetable gardens. In the gardens you'll find papaya, banana, tomatos, sugarcane, pineapple, string beans, morning glory, corn, mango, lettuce, and a ton more delicious eats.<br> The idea of Gaarawe is simple. Travelers stay in small bamboo huts for free and in exchange they work on the gardens and whatever other odd jobs that Lele has brainstormed for the day. Its an escape from societ as Lele describes it. Here its just you and a small group of travelers (never more than 6) with similar morals and ideas.<br> Its really important that I describe Lele as well as possible because he's a character. Lele is borderline insane. He's blind in one eye, smokes pot 24/7, and speaks a jumbled mess of English/Thai/Italian. Lele's definitely lived an interesting life theres no disputing that. The man has a genuine heart though. You can tell he cares for anybody that half way deserves to be cared about. He may even care to much.<br> After dinner tonight we all sat by the campfire. Nick picked up a guitar and Claire (his girlfriend) started to sing along. It was really beautiful. His guitar skills were good and her singing skills were good as well. But the special part is they made each other better. Her singing helped his guitar playing and vise-versa.</p7>

            <p7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Au-Nong (picture above) is a coastal city in Southern Thailand. Most people who want to visit Railay Beach and Tonsai Beach stay in Au-nang because of how cheap it is. A quick 10 minute ferry ride every morning gets you over to Tonsai/Railay. <br><br>Theme of the day: Timing is everything, while at the same time its nothing at all. <br><br>Yesterday I tried to reserve a bus ticket online to get me from Au-nong to Gaarawe Village. Who would of guessed.. the bus didn't show up. So yea they basically stole $20usd from me. It wasn't that money that got me really angry because honestly $20 is well umm $20. But it was the fact that I let myself get fooled. Instead of just booking through my hostel I attempted to book online through some stupid website. So I started yesterday off in a pretty angry mood.<br> I turned this around pretty quickly though and told myself I'd make the best of the misfortune. I found my Kiwi friends and we went to Railay and explored the area. We found a nature walk that you had to pull yourself up a cliffside by a rope. It brought you to an amazing vista overlooking Railay beach.<br> We made our way back to Au-nang and proceeded to the party thing (again). We meet a great group of brazilians (insanely hot) and spent the night dancing and partying. I walked home across town alone at 2am that night. I felt afraid but looking bad I think it was totally in my own mind.<br> The next day I reserved a trip to Gaarawe Village through my hostel as I should of done the day before. They showed up 1.5hrs late. In Thailand all the locals call this "Thai Time". If I had to put a description to the phrase I'd have to say its the act of being rude. However looking back to yesterday if my bus would of showed up I would of missed hanging with the Kiwi's and meeting my Brazilian friends last night. Who know's what would of happened if my bus had picked me up yesterday. The what if's are infinite. I think the only way to view things like this is to shrug your shoulders and say "oh well, fuck it". It's hard because in the U.S everyone is always on such a strict schedule it seems like everything needs to be done exactly by the book. I like to think I'm starting to learn to brake away from those norms. </p7>

            <p7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slinky Hostel (picture above) is one of probably 12 hostels/hotels on the North side of Koh Phi-Phi island in Southern Thailand. As you might infer by the picture its a total party hostel.<br><br>Theme of the day: Man I need to stop drinking.<br><br>On the 8th of February I took a ferry from Phuket to Koh Phi-Phi. The ferry ride was around 2hrs and I got the chance to work on editing my first video (now complete see instagram). I arrived to Phi-Phi (actually pronounced pee-pee) not really knowing what to expect. I checked into Slinky Hostel and within moments of being in the shared dormitory I had met 5 people and formed a group. We had some lunch and spent the day drinking beers on the beach. Night time came around and I was shocked.<br> All the hostels that are lined up along the beach roll out dance floors and dj's and the fun begins. First is the fire dancing which last for almost 2 hrs. The performers are of all ages from probably 8yrs old to 50 and of many different nationalities. After the fire dancing starts the real party. From one end of the beach to another is packed with people incoherently wandering about to the early hours of the morning. Koh Phi-Phi is one giant party and theres no doubt about that I got lost in the scene for four days.<br>I've partied hard in the past in college and at home. Foolishly I must say this was a bit of a challenge. My homies from New Zealand (the Kiwi's) are quite the party people. They pushed me to continue drinking and I pushed them. It was a wild few nights.<br>I basically crawled onto the ferry the last day begging for it all to be over. I was very happy to be leaving Koh Phi-Phi island. But I wouldn't of traded the last few nights for anything unless that anything was to have Jake and Cole with me to redo the experience. Boy oh boy would that of been fun... I was off to Au-Nang for some much needed TLC. </p7>

            <p7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tour of James Bond Island. From right to left; Maura (China), Michelle (Germany), oh and me (U.S). What cool people! Up to try new things and laidback.<br><br>This is the start of my trip and I have a million emotions running through my head. I definitely dont feel homesick yet but I keep asking myself what am I doing here? My first few days in Phuket have been great. I paid a local to take me on his motorbike to a few beaches. One of them I got to do some minor bouldering at. The wall was probably only 15 ft tall but it was above an 45+ degree rock incline. It was all good until a grabbed a hold of what I thought to be a safe rock and it pulled straight out of the cliff face. I fell probably 5ft and slid down the incline to the bottom. Scrapped my arm and knee up but only minor stuff.<br> Once I put myself together I laughed at how careless I was. In my opinion most of the best stories start with some careless-ness and pushing yourself to see what you can do. Getting hurt is almost funny to me. It'll probably bite me in the ass one day.<br>I met Maura and Michelle on my third day at 12month Hostel. I'm feeling pretty open to talking to travelers since most of the locals dont speak much English its nice to actually talk to someone and hear some of their stories. We agreed to go on a tour together to James Bond Island. It's the location where they filmed one of the old-school James Bond movies I guess? To be hoenst I didnt care about the Island at all. It was just fun to do something as a group. Our tour guide was a short, fat, gay Thai man. He was hilarious he kept yelling at everyone on the boat because we were being loud while he was trying to give his announcements. He would say "you respect me now and then I respect you". He also claimed to be a medical doctor from the U.S... yea okay buddy. At the end of the tour he told us he had a special show for us. All the ferry workers came upstairs dressed as lady boys and danced around and even gave some of the guys including myself lap dances. It was funny to see the old white dudes all grossed out by it. I took it in stride. Its all in good fun.<br> I leave tomorrow for Koh Phi-Phi Island. I can't wait to see what I'll get up to over there!</p7>
